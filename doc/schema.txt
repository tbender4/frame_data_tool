Schema Notes
======

===
Attack  // possibly break out to Normal Attack and have Attack be abstract?
===
command:string
startup:int
frame_advantage_hit:string          // validates integer or 'KND'
frame_advantage_counter_hit:string  // validates integer or 'KND'
frame_advantage_block:string        // validates integer or 'KND'
damage_hit:int
damage_counter_hit:int
damage_block:int
unblockable:string // 'all', 'high', 'low'
launcher_hit: boolean // validates if frame_advantage_hit = nil
launcher_counter_hit: boolean // validates if frame_advantage_hit = nil
launcher_block: boolean // validates if frame_advantage_hit = nil
while_rising: boolean
hit_location:string // 'high', 'mid', 'low'
properties:text // tailspin, floor_break, wall_break   (use AR Store to serialize as a hash).
                // https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Store.html
                // if this causes performance issues, add many more columns to schema
hits_grounded:string    // array of positions it can be hit grounded (sort of like a multi-boolean).
                        // could use bit-wise boolean but trying to avoid that
// need to figure out active frames and the sliding scale of start up and recovery changes
// probably missing some other stuff
// handle delayable moves
// handle spacing, pushbacks?
// handle knockdown
// previous_move:attack_foreign_key
// stance_parent:stance_foreign_key
// probably more foreign keys

===
Throw < Attack
===
// add throw-related properties
// change validation methods


===
Chain
===
// perhaps some linkedlist of some sorts

===
Stance
===
// belongs to a fighter

// also figure out how to handle patches / revisions
